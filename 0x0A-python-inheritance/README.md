# Python Inheritance

# This project explores the concept of inheritance in Python, a fundamental feature of object-oriented
#programming. It covers topics such as creating derived classes, method overriding, and the
#use of built-in functions like `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super`.

## Learning Objectives

# By the end of this project, you will be able to:

# - Understand the power and purpose of inheritance in Python.
# - Create derived classes to build specialized classes based on existing ones.
# - Override methods and attributes from base classes in derived classes.
# - Use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super` for type checking and inheritance-related tasks.

## Tasks

# This project consists of several tasks, including:

# - Implementing a function to list available attributes and methods of an object.
# - Creating a class that inherits from `list` and prints a sorted list.
# - Writing functions to check if an object is an instance of a specific class or its subclasses.
# - Building a hierarchy of classes with inheritance and method overriding.
# - Implementing a base class for geometric shapes and extending it with rectangles and squares.
# - Exploring advanced topics like operator overloading and adding attributes to objects.
