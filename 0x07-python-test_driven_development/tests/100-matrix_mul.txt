How to Use 100-matrix_mul.py
==============================

This module defines a matrix multiplication function ``matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)``.

Usage
=====

Matrix multiplication is performed using this function. The matrices `m_a` and `m_b` are provided as input, and the result of their multiplication is returned as a new matrix.

::

    >>> matrix_mul = __import__('100-matrix_mul').matrix_mul
    >>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    >>> m_b = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    >>> result = matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)
    >>> print(result)
    [[7, 10], [15, 22]]

::

    >>> m_a = [[1, 2]]
    >>> m_b = [[3, 4], [5, 6]]
    >>> result = matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)
    >>> print(result)
    [[13, 16]]

Invalid Matrices
================

There are several requirements for the input matrices:

1. Both `m_a` and `m_b` must be lists of lists containing only integers or floats.

::

    >>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, "4"]]  # Invalid: Contains a non-numeric element
    >>> matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: m_a should contain only integers or floats and m_b should contain only integers or floats

2. Both `m_a` and `m_b` must not be empty matrices.

::

    >>> m_a = [[]]  # Invalid: Empty matrix
    >>> matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: m_a can't be empty and m_b can't be empty

3. The number of columns in `m_a` must be equal to the number of rows in `m_b` for them to be multiplied.

::

    >>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    >>> m_b = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]  # Invalid: Incompatible dimensions
    >>> matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: m_a and m_b can't be multiplied

4. Both `m_a` and `m_b` must be rectangular matrices with rows of equal size.

::

    >>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]  # Invalid: Rows of different sizes
    >>> matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: each row of m_a must be of the same size and each row of m_b must be of the same size
